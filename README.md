# Modelling and Recognition of Retinal Blood Vessels Tortuosity in ROP Plus Disease: A Hybrid Segmentation-Classification Scheme

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains a significant cause of childhood blindness despite
advancements in neonatal care. Identifying the plus form of ROP, characterized by dilated and
tortuous blood vessels, is crucial for timely intervention.

This study introduces an intelligent segmentation-classification system for autonomous
detection of retinal blood vessels and classification of ROP plus form. Utilizing Clarity
RetCam 3 images, our system employs morphological image processing and convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation and classification, respectively.

Testing on a dataset of premature infants&#39; retinal images demonstrates high segmentation
accuracy (median=0.974) and superior classification performance (accuracy=0.975,
sensitivity=0.950, specificity=1). Additionally, the system exhibits versatility, with successful
segmentation in adult retinal images from public databases. These findings highlight the
system&#39;s potential for clinical use in retinal vessel identification, feature extraction, and ROP
plus form classification.

The proposed system is capable of effectively identifying retinal blood vessels from both
alternatives including adult and premature born retinal images with a high accuracy in the
contrast of related studies. Thus, this system has the potential to be used in the clinical
practice for the retinal blood vessels identification, retinal blood vessels feature extraction,
and ROP plus form classification.

This repository contains the source codes and data of the proposed model for segmentation of
retinal blood vessels and classification algorithms for the automatic recognition of ROP plus
form from the healthy retinal images.
